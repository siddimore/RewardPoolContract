# RewardPool contract: 
This RewardPool contract supports following tokens:

1. Fungible Token
2. Nonfungible Soulbound token aka Non Transferrable tokens

# FungibleToken RewardPools
For Fungible Tokens user is expected to deposit their collateral in the Reward Pool contract and get Rewarded for adding Liquidity, Reward pool will divy up the finite rewards as a function of time and contributed collateral

# NonFungible SoulboundToken RewardPool
For NonFungible Tokens user is expected to purchase an NonTransferrable NFT which opens the RewardPool and get Rewarded for buying token, Reward pool will divy up the finite rewards as a function of time and contributed collateral

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
